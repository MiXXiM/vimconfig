# vimconfig
TFL plugins and more for the Vi-IMproved (VIM) modal text editor.

**MASTER** - _Hopefully stable branch._\
**DEV** - _Development Branch (latest changes)_

## INTRODUCTION

I have quite the love for VIM, and I love tinkering with it as well, so I've taken the liberty of sharing my VIM configuration files, and the plugins I've written for use with VIM. I don't personally download other people's plugins (or shell scripts, for that matter) because I personally love to write and create these things myself, and to solve any puzzles on the way to getting the result I want; with this in mind, you'll probably find some other plugins which already do some or all of what I've done here -- fair warning!

This repository offers the following (self-written) plugins:

```
plugin/altnums.vim
plugin/autoscroll.vim
plugin/banger.vim
plugin/comtog.vim
plugin/datepaste.vim
plugin/exefile.vim
plugin/headup.vim
plugin/listmode.vim
plugin/moredoc.vim
plugin/mouseon.vim
plugin/mvline.vim
plugin/noarrows.vim
plugin/sanekeys.vim
plugin/simplyhard.vim
plugin/sudosave.vim
plugin/textwidth.vim
plugin/tflsnips.vim
plugin/tflstatus.vim
plugin/togtrans.vim
plugin/virtedit.vim
```

You'll also have access to my very own VIM syntax color theme:

```
colors/tfl.vim
```

Lastly, my core VIM configurations:

```
.vimrc
```
