# vimconfig
Various TFL configuration files for the Vi-IMproved (VIM) modal text editor.

**MASTER** - _Hopefully stable branch._\
**DEV** - _Development Branch (latest changes)_

## INTRODUCTION

This is a work in progress. I'm gradually splitting up various functionalities in my .vimrc file, as it's getting bigger than I expected, and I wanted to keep things separate, as I have done with bashconfig and the ShellPlugins directory. With this in mind, absolutely expect bugs until the transition is complete.

## INSTALLATION
